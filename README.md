# A Rust Gunpowder Calculator

## What do i mean with a rust gunpowder calculator?
**I mean that you can put in the amount of sulfur or charcoal you have and it will say how much of the other kind you need.**
**You can also put the ammout of gunpowder you want to create and it will show what you need for it.**

## Note:
**This is just me building a random program to improve my c++ skills. it may not be the best or good at all in that matter but i dont care to be honest. i just want to make stuff whatever i want**

## Is this a virus?
**No this is not a virus. (You can check the source code and compile if you dont belive me). windows is just saying its a virus cause its an console application.**
